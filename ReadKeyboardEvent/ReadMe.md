### Whatisthat?

if i push a key on my keyboard like just one not two or three because it won't work
it will show the keycode of they key you pressed.

### IsThataKeylogger?

Not intended to be.
Bash handle binary in an atrocious way (very the surprisingly) but if you are a bit creative why not?
i mean for now if the monkey with keyboard press maj+a key it will just show that monkey pressed maj which elimitate the uses as being monkeylogger
i should do a monkeylogger one day, it sounds hilariously good.

### WhyDaPhocDidYouPutThatHere

You deserve a golden banana for asking this.
jokes asides, i can have script that react to my keyboard inputs without being on my terminal which is what i wanted to do originally.
